# Yet Another ~~py~~Wal Neovim Colorscheme

I was inspired by the lacklusterness of all other neovim colorschemes based on
pywal that I found online, so I made this.

Yawnc's code is based on the [rose-pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim) nVim
colorscheme, which means that ~~all~~ *most of* the plugins that are supported by rose-pine,
are supported by this theme as well.

This is intended to be used with my pywal fork that takes advantage of my
iconema backend, but it can also be used with
[dylanaraps](https://github.com/dylanaraps)'
[pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal).

## Screenshots

#### Results depend on the colorscheme generated by pywal!
