# Yet Another ~~py~~Wal Neovim Colorscheme

I was inspired by the lacklusterness of all other neovim colorschemes based on
pywal that I found online, so I made this.

Yawnc's code is based on the [rose-pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim) nVim
colorscheme, which means that ~~all~~ *most of* the plugins that are supported by rose-pine,
are supported by this theme as well.

This is intended to be used with my pywal fork that takes advantage of my
iconema backend, but it can also be used with
[dylanaraps](https://github.com/dylanaraps)'
[pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal).

## Screenshots

None for now. Use your imagination or even better, just try it out.

## External Plugin Support

Check rose-pine's github page till I update this.

## Installation

### lazy
Add this to one of your plugin spec files.
```lua
not bothered enough to actually write this, sorry
```

### packer
```lua
use { "sonjiku/yawnc.nvim" }
```

### vim-plug
```vim
Plug "sonjiku/yawnc.nvim"
```

## Active theme

Put this somewhere in your neovim config
```vim
vim.cmd.colorscheme("yawnc")
```


## How it works

Magic
